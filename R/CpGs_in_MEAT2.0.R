#' Description of the CpGs used in MEAT2.0
#'
#' Detailed information on the 156 CpGs automatically selected by the elastic
#' net model.
#' @format A data frame with 157 rows and 6 variables:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{CpG}{CpG name}
#'   \item{Coefficient}{Weight given by the elastic net model to the CpG}
#'   \item{Chromosome}{Chromosome where the CpG is located}
#'   \item{Position}{Position in bp where the CpG is located (human genome
#'   build version hg38)}
#'   \item{Gene}{Gene annotated to the CpG. Each CpG was annotated to one or
#'   more genes using the annotation file from
#'   \href{https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/45/4/e22/2290930}{Zhou et al.}
#'   to which we added annotation to long-range interaction promoters using
#'   chromatin states in male skeletal muscle from the Roadmap Epigenomics
#'   Project and GeneHancer information from the Genome Browser (hg38).}
#'   \item{Chromatin_state_male_SM}{Chromatin state in male skeletal muscle
#'   from the the Roadmap Epigenomics Project)}
#'   }
