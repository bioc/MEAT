#' Elastic net model used in the updated muscle clock (MEAT 2.0).
#'
#' An object with S3 class "glmnet","elnet" generated by training 1,053
#' skeletal muscle DNA methylation profiles on a tranformed version of age.
#' This elastic net model can take in any skeletal muscle DNA methylation
#' profile that has been cleaned and calibrated to the GSE50498 gold standard
#' dataset, to estimate epigenetic age in the sample.
